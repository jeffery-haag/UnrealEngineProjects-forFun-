It's a pretty simple pong game made in unreal engine 4. I was trying to get the hang of the system, I did two single player levels where theres an easy and a hard 
ai controllin the enemy paddle respectfully. Theres a UI to select the game, working simple collisons, sound on collsions and victory, a scorecounter that displays the
score on screen.

NOTE: To actually run unzip the Engine/UE4Game first. I zipped it because it was over 100 mb and github didn't like that.
